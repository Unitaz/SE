This group is dedicated to creating a search engine and web browser with all profits going to animal rights/welfare charities.  Instead of giving our information to massive unethical companies who then sell it for vast profits, we will sell our own information to animal friendly companies. The money received will then be donated to charities and organisations focused on animal welfare/rights.  The decision making will be done by all citizens of the group on a democratic basis of 1 citizen = 1 vote. Anyone who sets the search engine as their default engine for a 6 month period will become a citizen.  Money will then be allocated to the areas that did the most searches and therefore raised the most money. Citizens in these areas will then be able to meet at the local level and discuss how they want the money to be spent.  We need people who can help with the programming, web design, video production/editing, marketing, translation, legalities etc.  If you have any of these skills, please join the group. Or, if you would like to be part of this group and support it, please help out in any way you can.  This can definitely be done and it will definitely help, so let's get it done!  http://www.unitaz.org/
